## 💰 Understanding Your Cloud Costs

### The Cloud Cost Pyramid

```
         ╱╲
        ╱  ╲       5% - Unnecessary/Waste
       ╱    ╲      (Immediate savings)
      ╱──────╲
     ╱        ╲    15% - Overprovisioned
    ╱          ╲   (Rightsizing opportunity)

- Similar to reserved instances in traditional data centers
- Available in 1-year or 3-year terms

**Discount Rates:**
| Commitment Type | 1-Year Discount | 3-Year Discount | Best For |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Resource CUD** | 37% | 70% | Stable, predictable workloads |

## 🎯 Making Strategic Decisions

### Decision Framework for CUD Purchases

```
Decision Tree:
│
├─ Is workload stable for 12+ months?
│  │
│  ├─ YES → Consider 3-year CUD (70% discount)
│  │   │
│  │   └─ Can you commit to 3 years?
│  │       ├─ YES → Purchase 3-year CUD
│  │       └─ NO → Purchase 1-year CUD
│  │
│  └─ NO → Is workload predictable for 6+ months?
│      │
│      ├─ YES → Consider 1-year CUD (37% discount)
│      └─ NO → Stay on-demand or use Spot
```

### Investment Prioritization Matrix

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### CUD Risk Assessment

**Risk Factors to Consider:**

| Risk Type | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Underutilization** | Not using committed capacity | Start conservative, monitor closely |
| **Technology Change** | Platform becomes obsolete | Shorter commitments for new tech |
| **Business Change** | Scaling down or pivoting | Maintain 30% flexibility |
| **Budget Constraints** | Cash flow issues | Stagger purchases quarterly |

### Risk Scoring Matrix

```
Risk Level = Probability × Impact

Low Risk (1-3):    ✅ Proceed with confidence
Medium Risk (4-6): ⚠️  Proceed with monitoring
High Risk (7-9):   🔴 Requires executive approval

Example:
3-Year CUD for stable workload:
- Probability of issue: 2 (Low)
- Impact if occurs: 4 (Medium)
- Risk Score: 8 (Medium-High)
- Decision: Proceed with 70% of capacity
```

### Monthly Risk Review Checklist

```
□ CUD utilization above 75%?
□ No unexpected cost spikes (>20%)?
□ Budget variance within 10%?
□ All departments tagged properly?
□ No security-related cost increases?
□ Forecast accuracy within 15%?
□ No major architecture changes planned?
□ Team capacity for optimizations?
```

- Historical data analysis (90 days)
- Industry benchmarks
- AI-powered predictions
- Conservative estimates (typically achieve 110-120% of projected savings)

**Q: What's the risk of implementing these recommendations?**
A: Risk levels vary:
- **Low Risk (80% of savings)**: Waste elimination, rightsizing
- **Medium Risk (15% of savings)**: 1-year CUDs
- **Higher Risk (5% of savings)**: 3-year commitments
