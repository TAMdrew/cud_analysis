## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Authentication Error**
   - Solution: Ensure you're logged into Google Colab with proper permissions
   - Run: `!gcloud auth application-default login`

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Solution: Re-run Section 1.1 to install all packages
   - Manual install: `!pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Data Loading Issues**
   - Solution: Use sample data generation for testing
   - Check file paths and permissions
   - Verify CSV format matches expected structure

4. **Gemini API Not Working**
   - Solution: Set GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable
   - Verify API key has proper permissions
   - AI insights are optional - analysis works without them
